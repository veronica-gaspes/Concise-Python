# Jupyter notebooks

In many of the courses that use Python at Halmstad University we use Jupyter Notebooks to develop programs.

The site [Scientific Python Quickstart](https://executablebooks.github.io/quantecon-mini-example/docs/getting_started.html) guides you to install and start using Jupyter notebooks.

The following video by Sebastian Eschweiler from [medium](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)   helps you get started with Jupyter notebooks, including how to install and start using them to program in Python.
