# Function definitions


You can define your own functions. Functions are introduced using the
keyword  ```def```.  You then need to provide
* a name of your function
* the arguments (just like variables)
* the body of the function (a code fragment to calculate what you want
with the arguments)
* a ```return``` statement to indicate  the value that the
function has calculated given the arguments.

```{note}
Functions in Python are a little bit more general than functions in
mathematics. They can be used to define commands. In this case they
might not calculate a value, just have an effect. In this case there
is no need for a ``` return``` statement.
```

The book
[Introduction to programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/)
presents function definitions in [chapter 2.1](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/21function/.)
