# Expressions

Expressions have values. Expressions are formed using literals, variables, operators, functions and methods. This chapter shows you how to form expressions of different types. 

The book [Introduction to programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/) presents some expressions in [chapter 1.2](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/12types/.)
