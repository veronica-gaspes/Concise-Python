# A concise presentation of Python

This short book addresses students that have already taken a
course in programming and need to become familiar with Python. We hope
it will be useful for students that will take courses that use Python to teach
algorithms, data structures and libraries for dealing with tabular
data and for linear algebra.


The book does not include many explanations but uses instead a lot of examples. 
For further details,
explanations and examples it includes references to the [Python
documentation](http://www.python.org) and to
[An introduction to programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/),
an introductory book by
Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero from Princeton University.

The book is designed for the student work in parallell reading it and testing and
tweaking the code. Code fragments can be copied and used in a Jupyter
notebook or any other environment for running Python. 

The book uses Python 3 and we make no comparisons with Python 2.
