# Expressions

Expressions have values. Expressions are formed using literals, variables, operators, functions and methods.

You need to know that there are different **types**  of values. This chapter shows you how to form expressions that have values of the numerical types integer and float, booleans, strings, tuples and lists.

The sections of this chapters on expressions have parts dedicated to the different types. So, if you are interested in knowing about operators for a given type you will have to look into the section on operators and there find your type. For doing this you can look at the table of contents that appears to the right when you select a section.

The book [Introduction to programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/) presents some expressions in [chapter 1.2](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/12types/.)
